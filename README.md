# The Go Libraries

These codes are supplementary to the golang standard library. We provide some commonly used high-quality libraries here to make your development process easier.

## Installation

To use go libraries, ensure you have go installed (version 1.23 or higher is recommended). Install the library with the following command:

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/libraries/go
```
